### About Me

I create software that powers real-world experiences. From frontend to backend, I enjoy building full-stack projects with clean and (not so) efficient code. Leading ytmp3.cc as the founder has totally taught me how to bring ideas to life and deliver MUCH value.

I work with a variety of languages and frameworks and love learning new technologies to keep improving.
